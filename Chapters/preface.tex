To the interested reader,
\\
\\
This document is a compilation of lecture notes taken during the Spring 2023 semester for MATH1300: Calculus I at the University of Colorado Boulder. The course used \textit{Calculus -- Concepts and Contexts}\footnote{Andrilli, S., \& Hecker, D. (2016). \textit{Elementary Linear Algebra} (5th ed.). Academic Press.} by James Stewart as its primary text. Additionally, in creating these notes, the author used \textit{Calculus} by Ron Larson and Bruce Edwards. As such, many theorems, definitions, and examples may be quoted or derived from the aforementioned books.
\\

The author would like to provide the following resources for students currently taking a Calculus I course:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \href{https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/classes/calci/calci.aspx}{Paul's \textit{Online Math Notes} for Calculus I at Lamar University.}
    \item \href{https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF797E961509B4EB5}{Professor Leonard's YouTube Calculus I Lectures.}
    \item \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM&list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr}{3Blue1Brown's \textit{Essence of Calculus}.}
\end{enumerate}
