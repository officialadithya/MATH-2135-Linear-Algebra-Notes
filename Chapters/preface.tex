To the interested reader,

This document is a compilation of lecture notes taken during the Fall 2022 semester for MATH2135: Linear Algebra for Mathematics Majors at the University of Colorado Boulder. The course used \textit{Elementary Linear Algebra}\footnote{Andrilli, S., \& Hecker, D. (2016). \textit{Elementary Linear Algebra} (5th ed.). Academic Press.} by Stephen Andrilli and David Hecker as its primary text. As such, many theorems, definitions, and content may be quoted from the book. This course was taught by Robin Deeley, Ph. D.
\\
\\
Appendix A is provided as a nonexhaustive refresher on proof techniques commonly covered in a Discrete Mathematics course. Appendix A is a result of lecture notes compiled during the Summer 2022 semester for MATH2520: Discrete Mathematics at Front Range Community College. This course was taught by Kenneth M. Monks, Ph. D. The primary text was Oscar Levin's \textit{Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction}\footnote{Levin, O. (2019). \textit{Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction} (3rd ed.). Oscar Levin.}, but Richard Hammack's \textit{Book of Proof}\footnote{Hammack, R. (2018). \textit{Book of Proof} (3rd ed.). Richard Hammack.} was also used as supplement.
