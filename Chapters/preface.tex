To the interested reader,
\\

This document is a compilation of lecture notes taken during the Fall 2022 semester for MATH2135: Linear Algebra for Mathematics Majors at the University of Colorado Boulder. The course used \textit{Elementary Linear Algebra}\footnote{Andrilli, S., \& Hecker, D. (2016). \textit{Elementary Linear Algebra} (5th ed.). Academic Press.} by Stephen Andrilli and David Hecker as its primary text. As such, many theorems, definitions, and content may be quoted from the book. This course was taught by Robin Deeley, Ph. D.
\\
\\
Appendix \ref{appendix:a} is provided as a nonexhaustive refresher on proof techniques commonly covered in a Discrete Mathematics course. Appendix \ref{appendix:a} is a result of lecture notes compiled during the Summer 2022 semester for MATH2520: Discrete Mathematics at Front Range Community College. This course was taught by Kenneth M. Monks, Ph. D. The primary text was Oscar Levin's \textit{Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction}\footnote{Levin, O. (2019). \textit{Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction} (3rd ed.). Oscar Levin.}, but Richard Hammack's \textit{Book of Proof}\footnote{Hammack, R. (2018). \textit{Book of Proof} (3rd ed.). Richard Hammack.} was also used as supplement.
\\
\\
Appendix \ref{appendix:b} is provided as a nonexhaustive refresher on functions, as preparation for Chapter \ref{chapter:lintrans}. Appendix \ref{appendix:b} is a result of both content covered in \textit{Elementary Linear Algebra} and MATH2520 lecture notes.

While much effort has been put in to remove typos and mathematical errors, it is very likely that some errors, both small and large, are present. Please keep in mind that the author wrote this resource during his first semester of his undergraduate studies.

Finally, the author would like to dedicate this set of lecture notes to \textit{Aidan Janney}, \textit{Erika Sj\"{o}blom}, and \textit{Tate McDonald}, three of the author's closest friends who plan to take Linear Algebra in the upcoming semester, at the time of writing.
