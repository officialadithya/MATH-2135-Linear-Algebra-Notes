To the interested reader,\
\
This document is a compilation of lecture notes taken during the Fall
2022 semester for MATH2135: Linear Algebra for Mathematics Majors at the
University of Colorado Boulder. The course used *Elementary Linear
Algebra*[^1] by Stephen Andrilli and David Hecker as its primary text.
As such, many theorems, definitions, and content may be quoted from the
book. This course was taught by Robin Deeley, Ph. D.\
\
Appendix A is provided as a nonexhaustive refresher on
proof techniques commonly covered in a Discrete Mathematics course.
Appendix A is a result of lecture notes compiled during the
Summer 2022 semester for MATH2520: Discrete Mathematics at Front Range
Community College. This course was taught by Kenneth M. Monks, Ph. D.
The primary text was Oscar Levin's *Discrete Mathematics: An Open
Introduction*[^2], but Richard Hammack's *Book of Proof*[^3] was also
used as supplement.\
\
Appendix B is provided as a nonexhaustive refresher on
functions, as preparation for Chapter 5. Appendix
B is a result of both content covered in
*Elementary Linear Algebra* and MATH2520 lecture notes.\

The author would like to provide the following resources for students
currently taking a Linear Algebra course:

1.  [Sergei Treil's *Linear Algebra Done
    Wrong*.](https://www.math.brown.edu/streil/papers/LADW/LADW_2017-09-04.pdf)

While much effort has been put in to remove typos and mathematical
errors, it is very likely that some errors, both small and large, are
present. Please keep in mind that the author wrote this resource during
his first semester of his undergraduate studies. If an error needs to be
resolved, please contact Adithya Bhaskara at

\
Finally, the author would like to dedicate this set of lecture notes to
*Aidan Janney*, *Erika Sj√∂blom*, and *Tate McDonald*, three of the
author's closest friends who plan to take Linear Algebra in the upcoming
semester; Spring 2023, at the time of writing.\
